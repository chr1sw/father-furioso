  Ol' Father Biff is revving his engine.  This coming Sunday ends the Church
  Year with the feast of Christ the King.  Then the new liturgical year starts
  on December 2 with the First Sunday of Advent.  Hanukkah begins on that
  evening also, early this year.  Old Biffer has granted permission to record
  and publish his daily sermons.  He's loved by some though loathed by many. 
  Yes, he's ready to kick some serious cultural ass.  Lackluster preaching has
  practically emptied many Catholic churches.  If the men of the cloth will only
  copy the Biffer, the houses of God will be packed like one of the Trumper's
  political rallies.  As the good father said to me recently, "Hand me that
  loudspeaker and stand back."
